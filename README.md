### Environment configuration
```bash
POSTGRES_PASSWORD = "password" # password for postgres
POSTGRES_USER = "postgres_username" # username for postgres
POSTGRES_DB = "todoapp" # database to use
PG_HOST = "127.0.0.1" # hostname for postgres
PG_PORT = "5432" # port for database connection
DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/todoapp?schema=public" # database URL for prisma
REDIS_URL = "redis://user:password@localhost:6379" # connection string for redis
REDIS_PASSWORD = "password" # password for redis
```

Make sure to protect your secrets well ðŸ˜¼  
### Running with Docker
- Change `PG_HOST` to `db` and change your connection string to match that.
- Provide a connection URL to Redis
- Run `docker compose up`  

You should be good to go  

### Database configuration
When using Docker compose, the database will be set up automatically for you. You don't need to touch the SQL files. 
If you are using a different Postgres server, use `init.sql` to set up the tables and remove the `db` service if you want to.  
If you have a Redis instance somewhere else, pass the connection URL for it.
